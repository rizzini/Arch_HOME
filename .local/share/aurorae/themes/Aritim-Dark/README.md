### **FIREFOX THEME**

### **LICENSE**
This Aurorae Theme is deeply inspired from [`"Breezemite"`](https://store.kde.org/p/1169286/) Aurorae theme.
Some modifications have been made in order to try to match the [`"Sierra Breeze"`](https://github.com/ishovkun/SierraBreeze) window decorations (which are, in their turn, inspired by [`"Breezemite"`](https://store.kde.org/p/1169286/), but with many additional user settings).
I made this theme to satisfy the many users of the OpenDesktop site who have repeatedly asked me to provide an Aurorae theme to Aritim-Dark.

I myself prefer to use the window decorations [`"Sierra Breeze"`](https://github.com/ishovkun/SierraBreeze), which are not available in the KDE Store and which require a less immediate installation (CLI use). I hope that Aritim-Dark-Aurorae-Theme can satisfy all these users who prefer a more immediate installation, without the help of the command line :)

Finally, this Aurorae-Theme is licensed under the [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/Mrcuve0/Aritim-Dark-Aurorae-Theme/blob/master/LICENSE)
